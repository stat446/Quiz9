#### 1. (5 points)
Describe the process for finding the variance of stratified sample estimator for a population mean. You are welcome to use mathematical equations or prose.

### 2. (5 point)
Variance calculations for ratio estimators require the term $s_e^2$. Provide some intuition behind the quantity $y_i -\hat{B}x_i$ that shows up in this variance calculation. Recall the variance for srs used $y_i -\bar{y}$.
